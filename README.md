normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) approach for using spectral counting in quantitative proteomics

Normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAFs) provides an improved measure for relative abundance, by factoring the length of the protein 
into subsequent calculations. A NSAF value for a given protein is calculated by dividing the spectral counts (SpC) for a protein by its length (L). This value is then normalized by dividing by the sum of all SpC/L for all proteins identiÔ¨Åed in a complex mixture.
